# Dungeon Runner
## About
Build a party of heroes to fight through dungeons of enemies in Pokemon-esque turn-based combat! Heroes permanently gain experience and power the more battles they win and persist across play sessions. 

This is a personal project I've been working on for the past month intended to be used as an excuse to learn tools development. While the base game has lots of interesting technical challenges, my main focus is on building a companion desktop app that can be used to design the heroes, enemies, and levels in the game. This app will let designers create custom moves and effects, set character stats, draw ASCII art for the game, and more!

## Current Progress
I am a little more than half-way done with the base game. I have the main game loop working on a basic level, but there are still quite a few bugs and unhandled errors mainly due to a lack of input validation. My hope is to finish the base game by next month and then transition to building the game designer app... exciting!
